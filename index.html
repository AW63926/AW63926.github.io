			I am a full-stack Developer in process living in Columbus, Ohio. I am a Graduate of The Ohio State University, holding a Bachelor's Degree in English Literature. After several years working in advertising, I decided to let my passion guide me, and I began working towards a career in Software and Web Development.  In addition to my passion for development, I am also a musician, and I am interested in the ways my development work can interface with music production, software and other aspects of performance.  I am a highly motivated professional with a continuous drive to expand my horizons both professionally and personally.

I have truly gotten great enjoyment from creating each of the projects I have displayed here, and I hope that as I continue to progress through my career, the enjoyment I feel in developing each application is felt by the end user.
